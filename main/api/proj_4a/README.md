Description: This folder comprises of different encryption APIs and Utilities coded in Python 3.x for the Python SDK for AtSign as a part of 682 course (MS CS - UMass Boston) Project 4a

More about the Encryption API: It makes use of the following encryption and decryption algorithms:
RSA Encryption 2048 (Sign, Verify, Encrypt, Decrypt) & Keypair Generation, Base64 Encode/Decode, AES CTR 256 Encrypt/Decrypt, & Key Generation

Structure:
Abstract Class: Encryption.py
Implementation Classes: Format: xyz_encryption.py
Utility: encryption_util.py

Usage:
1) Use the EncryptionUtil in the main SDK to get the functionality of all the algorithms. 
2) xyz_encryption is for individual implementation of an encryption algorithm, it has to implement the abstract class encryption.py and implement the abstract methods encrypt() and decrypt().

Algorithm:
